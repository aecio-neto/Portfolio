### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I reviewed some points about semantic html, media queryes and how flexbox works.

### Continued development

Keep building projects with html, css and javascript. My goal is to gain experience and understand the fundamentals of each language.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox crash course 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA) - Great tutorial which helped me better understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Improve your CSS by organizing your properties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y03OSNw6zo) - This video gave me some ideas to organize my css.
