## My process

I started to develop the desktop layout, one thing at a time, from top to bottom.

After defining the styles (fonts, spacing and colors), I adjusted the layout to make it responsive. (media queries)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I understood better how to use css custom properties and also media queries.

### Continued development

I'll keep building things. #LFG
